Whenever I go to the beach there's always a trip to the candy store involved. I love the idea of jawbreakers, but they're not really fulfilling because they take so long to finish.
What else could I do but opt for the mix of gummies and hard candies that would leave my teeth rotten and my break "fragrant?"
