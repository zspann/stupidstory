Whenever I go to the beach there's always a trip to the candy store involved. I love the idea of jawbreakers, but they're not really fulfilling because they take so long to finish.
What else could I do but opt for the mix of gummies and hard candies that would leave my teeth rotten and my break "fragrant?"

For this reason, I'll go for mints! Then, my breath will be fresh and I'll still get a sugar fix.

WOOF SAID THE DOG.S SWIM SAID THE SWAN.
